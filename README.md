Day2-(22-01-25): I learned about different types of operators, such as arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators, which help perform calculations and comparisons in a program. I also practiced taking user input, allowing programs to interact with users by accepting values dynamically. By combining operators and user input, I implemented simple programs like addition, finding the largest number, and checking conditions. This helped me understand how to process user data and perform operations based on input. Overall, it improved my logical thinking and coding skills.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day3-(23-01-25): I explored looping and conditional statements by writing hands-on programs that control the flow of execution based on conditions and repetitions. Conditional statements like `if`, `if-else`, and `switch` help make decisions based on user input or calculations. Looping constructs such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` allow repetitive execution of code until a condition is met. I implemented programs like checking even or odd numbers, printing patterns, and calculating sums using loops. This practice improved my understanding of logic-building and problem-solving in programming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day4-(25-01-25): I worked with 1D and 2D arrays and implemented programs to understand their usage. 1D arrays store a list of elements in a single row, accessed using an index. I practiced operations like inserting, deleting, searching, and sorting elements in a 1D array. 2D arrays represent data in a table format with rows and columns, useful for matrix operations and storing structured data. I implemented programs for matrix addition, multiplication, and transposition. Working with arrays improved my skills in handling large datasets efficiently and organizing data systematically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day5-(28-01-25):I practiced creating and using methods in programs to improve code reusability and organization. Methods help break a program into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier to read and debug. I implemented user-defined methods to perform specific tasks like calculations, string operations, and logical processing. I also worked with parameterized methods to pass values and return results. Additionally, I explored built-in methods for common operations like mathematical calculations and string manipulations. This practice enhanced my understanding of modular programming and improved code efficiency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day6-(29-01-25): I learned about strings, which are sequences of characters used to store and manipulate text. I practiced various string operations like concatenation, length calculation, substring extraction, and case conversion. I also implemented programs to reverse a string, check for palindromes, count vowels and consonants, and find word occurrences in a sentence. Additionally, I explored built-in string functions for searching, replacing, and formatting text. This practice helped me understand how to handle and process textual data efficiently in programming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day7-(31-01-25): I learned about constructors and methods and how they help in creating and managing objects in a program. Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects automatically when a class is created. I practiced different types of constructors, like default, parameterized, and copy constructors, to set initial values for objects. I also worked with methods to perform specific tasks, making code reusable and organized. By implementing real-world examples, such as calculating student grades and managing bank accounts, I understood how constructors and methods improve program efficiency and structure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day8-(01-02-25): I learned about constructors, instance variables, class variables, and access modifiers and how they work in a program. Constructors are special methods that initialize objects automatically. Instance variables belong to an object and store unique data for each object, while class variables are shared among all objects of a class. Access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected` control the visibility of variables and methods. I implemented programs using these concepts to understand how they help in organizing and securing data in object-oriented programming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day9-(04-02-25): I explored and used the static, final, and instanceof keywords in programs to understand their roles in Java. The static keyword is used for variables and methods that belong to the class rather than a specific object, making them shared among all objects. The final keyword is used to make variables constant, prevent method overriding, and restrict class inheritance. The instanceof keyword helps check whether an object belongs to a specific class or subclass. I implemented programs using these keywords to see how they help in memory management, security, and runtime type checking.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day10-(05-02-25): In Java, objects are instances of a class, created using the new keyword. An array of objects allows multiple objects of the same type to be stored and managed efficiently. Each object in the array must be initialized separately. You can use loops to iterate through the array and access object properties or methods. This approach is useful for handling collections of related data dynamically.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day11-(07-02-25):Learned basic java concepts about Inheritance. Hybrid, Multilevel and Single Inheritance. Also performed Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces. 
Single Inheritance: One class inherits from another.
Multilevel Inheritance: A chain of inheritance.
Hybrid Inheritance: A mix of multiple inheritance types, achieved using interfaces.
Multiple Inheritance: Not allowed with classes, but possible using interfaces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day-(10-02-25): In this assignment I have learned OOPS concept with proper implementation.Encapsulation protects data by using `private` fields with `public` getters and setters, ensuring controlled access. Polymorphism makes code flexible by allowing methods to be overridden and used dynamically. Interfaces define reusable behaviors, promoting modular design, while abstract classes share common functionality among related classes. Prefer composition over inheritance to avoid complex hierarchies and improve maintainability. Keep inheritance shallow to make the code easier to manage. Use validation in setters to maintain data integrity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day13-(11-02-25):In this Assignment I have learned real life problems using singly,doubly and circular linkedlist.Singly linked lists can manage browser histories by sequentially adding visited URLs, allowing users to go back efficiently but with one-way navigation. Doubly linked lists are ideal for music playlists, enabling both forward and backward song navigation for easy skipping or replaying. Circular linked lists are useful in round-robin CPU scheduling, cycling through tasks continuously to ensure equal CPU time for all processes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day14-(13-02-25): n this Asignments I have learned and came up with algorithms to solve problems using HashMap, HashSet, Stacks and Queues, whilst learning about their basic operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day15-(14-02-25):In this Assignment I have Learned and implemented array sorting algorithms as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Counting Sort.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day16-(15-02-25):In this Assignment I have learned and Implement the StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable string classes, with StringBuilder being faster but not thread-safe, while StringBuffer is synchronized for thread safety. FileReader and InputStreamReader are used for reading character and byte streams, respectively. Linear Search scans each element sequentially, while Binary Search efficiently halves the search space on sorted data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day17-(17-02-25): In this Assignment I have learned and Implement. The Runtime analysis evaluates how efficient an algorithm is, especially as input size grows. Big-O notation expresses its upper-bound performance. Time and space complexity measure how execution time and memory usage change with input size. Understanding best, worst, and average cases helps optimize Java code for both typical and edge scenarios.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day18-(18-02-25): In this Assignment I have learned about the Generics and solve some problems on that. Generics allows to create method ,interface and with type parameter for strong type checking at compile time.
