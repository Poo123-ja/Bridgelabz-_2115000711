Day1-(19-01-25): Practicing basic programs using mathematical formulas helps build a strong foundation in programming logic and mathematical problem-solving. These programs typically involve fundamental arithmetic operations, algebraic equations, and geometric calculations.
key concepts like:--
Arithmetic Operations – Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\
Algebraic Formulas – Solving quadratic equations, area and perimeter calculations.\
Geometric Formulas – Circle area (πr²), triangle area ((1/2) × base × height).\
Physics Formulas – Speed (distance/time), force (mass × acceleration).\
Financial Calculations – Simple interest ((P × R × T)/100), compound interest.\

Day2-(22-01-25): I learned about different types of operators, such as arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators, which help perform calculations and comparisons in a program. I also practiced taking user input, allowing programs to interact with users by accepting values dynamically. By combining operators and user input, I implemented simple programs like addition, finding the largest number, and checking conditions. This helped me understand how to process user data and perform operations based on input. Overall, it improved my logical thinking and coding skills.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day3-(23-01-25): I explored looping and conditional statements by writing hands-on programs that control the flow of execution based on conditions and repetitions. Conditional statements like `if`, `if-else`, and `switch` help make decisions based on user input or calculations. Looping constructs such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` allow repetitive execution of code until a condition is met. I implemented programs like checking even or odd numbers, printing patterns, and calculating sums using loops. This practice improved my understanding of logic-building and problem-solving in programming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day4-(25-01-25): I worked with 1D and 2D arrays and implemented programs to understand their usage. 1D arrays store a list of elements in a single row, accessed using an index. I practiced operations like inserting, deleting, searching, and sorting elements in a 1D array. 2D arrays represent data in a table format with rows and columns, useful for matrix operations and storing structured data. I implemented programs for matrix addition, multiplication, and transposition. Working with arrays improved my skills in handling large datasets efficiently and organizing data systematically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day5-(28-01-25):I practiced creating and using methods in programs to improve code reusability and organization. Methods help break a program into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier to read and debug. I implemented user-defined methods to perform specific tasks like calculations, string operations, and logical processing. I also worked with parameterized methods to pass values and return results. Additionally, I explored built-in methods for common operations like mathematical calculations and string manipulations. This practice enhanced my understanding of modular programming and improved code efficiency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day6-(29-01-25): I learned about strings, which are sequences of characters used to store and manipulate text. I practiced various string operations like concatenation, length calculation, substring extraction, and case conversion. I also implemented programs to reverse a string, check for palindromes, count vowels and consonants, and find word occurrences in a sentence. Additionally, I explored built-in string functions for searching, replacing, and formatting text. This practice helped me understand how to handle and process textual data efficiently in programming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day7-(31-01-25): I learned about constructors and methods and how they help in creating and managing objects in a program. Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects automatically when a class is created. I practiced different types of constructors, like default, parameterized, and copy constructors, to set initial values for objects. I also worked with methods to perform specific tasks, making code reusable and organized. By implementing real-world examples, such as calculating student grades and managing bank accounts, I understood how constructors and methods improve program efficiency and structure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day8-(01-02-25): I learned about constructors, instance variables, class variables, and access modifiers and how they work in a program. Constructors are special methods that initialize objects automatically. Instance variables belong to an object and store unique data for each object, while class variables are shared among all objects of a class. Access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected` control the visibility of variables and methods. I implemented programs using these concepts to understand how they help in organizing and securing data in object-oriented programming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Day9-(04-02-25): I explored and used the static, final, and instanceof keywords in programs to understand their roles in Java. The static keyword is used for variables and methods that belong to the class rather than a specific object, making them shared among all objects. The final keyword is used to make variables constant, prevent method overriding, and restrict class inheritance. The instanceof keyword helps check whether an object belongs to a specific class or subclass. I implemented programs using these keywords to see how they help in memory management, security, and runtime type checking.
